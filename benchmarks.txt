Some brainstormed benchmarks. Making these rigorous will be interesting.
--

Should be able to see "aberrant" proteins even if they phologenetically cluster with apparently non-aberrant proteins.

("Aberrant" proteins might be recognizable by external evidence, like the lack of obligate domains combined with transition to a pathogenic host; or by internal evidence we might mask, such as a nonfunctional catalytic region.)

Should be able to see transmembrane or signal-peptide induced false hits to Pfam families even if the false hits don't form a phylogenetic cluster with each other.

Should be able to visually distinguish changes to highly conserved residues that result in a nonfunctional protein from (what outside evidence suggests are) spurious changes to highly conserved residues.

Should be possible to see adaptation to a basic/acidic/hot environment.

Should be easy to see a lineage expansion.

Should be easy to identify sequence features characteristic of certain branches on the tree of life.

Should be easy to see changes to the locus of selection pressure.

Should be easy to see changes to type of selection pressure.

Should be easy to visualize relaxation of selection pressure after a loss or change of function of the protein.

Should be easy to recognize the independent origin of 2 different loop insertions that occur at the same site at different times.

Should be possible to visually distinguish "patterned regions" (like signal peptides) from globular region of protein. (It's one thing to say that an suitable algorithm should find these regions; it's another to say they should be *visible*)
